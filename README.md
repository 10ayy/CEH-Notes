# 🛡️ CEH v13 Notes by T10ayy
Welcome to my **Certified Ethical Hacker(CEHv13)** study notes repository.
This repository contains my day-wise notes from the **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH v13)** training. It includes key concepts, tools, commands, and practical exercises that I am learning as I progress through the official CEH course.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Maintain structured, consistent documentation of my daily learning.
- Reinforce knowledge through note-taking and practical command usage.
- Create a public knowledge base to help myself and others revising CEH.
- At the end of my course, I will convert these notes into a **comprehensive Document/PDF**.
