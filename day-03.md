## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔍 What is Footprinting?
Footprinting is the process of gathering information about a target system or organization to identify potential attack vectors. It is the **first phase of ethical hacking**.

### 🔄 Types of Footprinting

| Type     | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Passive** | No direct interaction with the target; uses public sources (OSINT). |
| **Active**  | Directly engages with the target systems (e.g., ping, traceroute). |

### 🔎 Footprinting Methodology
- Footprinting through Search Engines
- Footprinting through Web Services
- Footprinting through Social Networking Sites
- Website Footprinting
- Email Footprinting
- Whois Footprinting
- DNS Footprinting
- Network Footprinting
- Footprinting through Social Engineering

### 📑 DNS Record Types

| Record | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| A      | Maps hostname to IP address |
| MX     | Mail exchange server info |
| NS     | Nameserver information |
| CNAME  | Canonical name (alias) |
| SOA    | Start of Authority |
| PTR    | Reverse DNS mapping |
| TXT    | Miscellaneous text info (SPF, DKIM etc.) |

### ⚠️ Footprinting Threats
- Data leakage
- Social engineering
- Network compromise
- Legal consequences if not conducted ethically

### 📌 Summary
Day 3 laid the foundational understanding of reconnaissance—arguably one of the most critical phases in ethical hacking. The focus was on **what** data can be collected and **how** it sets up the attacker for future phases like scanning and exploitation.
