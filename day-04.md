## 🔍 Google Dorking

**Google Dorking** involves using advanced search operators to find specific information through Google search.

| Operator | Example | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `site:`     | `site:example.com` | Search within a specific domain |
| `filetype:` | `filetype:pdf` | Search specific file types |
| `intitle:`  | `intitle:login` | Find pages with “login” in the title |
| `inurl:`    | `inurl:admin` | Find URLs containing “admin” |

⚠️ These techniques are powerful and must be used responsibly. They fall under passive footprinting.

## 📌 Summary
Day 4 provided a practical toolkit to execute real-world reconnaissance using both command-line and web-based resources. Mastery of these tools is critical to understanding the **digital surface area** of a target before deeper penetration efforts.
