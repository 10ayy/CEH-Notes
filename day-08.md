## üëæ Introduction to Malware

Malware, or ‚Äúmalicious software,‚Äù is an umbrella term that describes any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems. Malware includes computer viruses, worms, Trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, and other malicious programs. Individuals and organizations need to be aware of the different types of malware and take steps to protect their systems, such as using antivirus software, keeping software and systems up-to-date, and being cautious when opening email attachments or downloading software from the internet.

## üï∑ Types of Malware:

- Viruses ‚Äì Attach themselves to host files and replicate.
- Worms ‚Äì Self-replicating programs that spread without user intervention.
- Keyloggers ‚Äì Record keystrokes to steal sensitive information.
- Spyware ‚Äì Secretly monitors user activity.
- Trojan Horses ‚Äì Disguised as legitimate software.
- Remote Access Trojans (RATs) ‚Äì Provide unauthorized control of a target system.
- Adware ‚Äì Displays unwanted advertisements, often bundled with freeware.
- Ransomware ‚Äì Encrypts user data and demands ransom for decryption.

## üß© Components of Malware

| Malware Component  | Description                                                                                                     | 
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Crypter            | A tool that encrypts or obfuscates malicious code to evade detection by antivirus software                      |
| Downloader         | A lightweight malicious program designed to retrieve and install additional payloads from remote servers        |
| Dropper            | A self-contained malware installer that embeds and deploys malicious code onto a target system                  |
| Exploit            | A piece of code or script that leverages vulnerabilities in software to execute unauthorized actions            |
| Obfuscator         | A utility that deliberately complicates code structure to hinder reverse engineering or static analysis         |
| Packer             | A software tool that compresses or encrypts executables to conceal their true nature and behavior               |
| Payload            | The core component of malware responsible for executing the attacker‚Äôs intended malicious activity              |
| Malicious Code     | Any piece of software or script specifically crafted to harm, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a system  |

## üê¥ Trojans Concepts

Trojan is aprogram in which the **malicious** or **harmful code** is contained inside an apparently harmless program or data, which can later gain control and cause damage. Trojans get actived when a **user performs certain predefined actions**. It **create a covert communication channel between the victim computer and the attacker for tramsferring sensitive data.

### ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• Types of Trojans
