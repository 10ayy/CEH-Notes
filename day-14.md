# Day 14 ‚Äì Social Engineering (Module 9)

## üéØ Module Introduction: Social Engineering

On Day 14, I began exploring **Module 9: Social Engineering**, a critical topic in penetration testing and red teaming. This module focuses on manipulating human psychology to gain unauthorized access to systems or information without technical exploitation. It reinforces the idea that **"humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity."**

## üß† What is Social Engineering?

**Social engineering** is the art of manipulating individuals to perform actions or disclose confidential information. It relies more on **psychological manipulation** than technical hacking and is commonly used as a **pre-attack or post-exploitation strategy**.

## üß© Types of Social Engineering:

### 1. **Human-Based Social Engineering:**
- Impersonation (e.g., helpdesk, delivery personnel)
- Eavesdropping
- Shoulder Surfing
- Dumpster Diving
- Tailgating

### 2. **Computer-Based Social Engineering:**
- Phishing Emails
- Pop-ups and Fake Software Updates
- Social Media Lures

### 3. **Mobile-Based Social Engineering:**
- Vishing (Voice Phishing)
- Smishing (SMS Phishing)
- Malicious QR Codes
- Fake Mobile Apps

---

## üåÄ Phases of a Social Engineering Attack:

1. **Reconnaissance:** Collecting intel on target company, employees, roles, email formats, etc.
2. **Target Selection:** Choosing the weakest or most privileged target.
3. **Relationship Building:** Gaining trust or impersonating authority figures.
4. **Exploitation:** Executing the attack to extract credentials or gain system access.

## üö® Insider Threats/ Insider Attacks:

**Insider threats** refer to malicious or negligent employees, contractors, or associates who have authorized access and misuse it.

### üßë‚Äçüíº Types of Insider Attacks:
- **Malicious Insiders:** Intentionally harm the organization (e.g., stealing data)
- **Negligent Insiders:** Accidental data leaks or security policy violations
- **Compromised Insiders:** Hacked accounts used by external attackers

## ‚úÖ Summary

Day 14 provided deep insights into the **human factors in cybersecurity breaches**. I explored the psychology behind social engineering attacks, their lifecycle, and the range of tools that can automate phishing and impersonation techniques. This module strengthens both technical knowledge and behavioral awareness, making it essential for aspiring red teamers and ethical hackers.
