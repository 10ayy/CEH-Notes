# Day 22 ‚Äì TryHackMe Practical and PortSwigger Introduction

## üß™ Practical Lab

### ‚úÖ TryHackMe Room: **RootMe**
- Our mentor demonstrated the **RootMe** room from TryHackMe.
- This lab was used to apply prior theoretical and practical knowledge related to:
  - **Service enumeration**
  - **Directory brute forcing**
  - **Gaining access by file upload vulnerability**
  - **Privilege escalation**

- Key concepts reinforced:
  - Identifying open ports and running services using **nmap**
  - Finding subdirectories with tools like **gobuster**
  - Creating reverse shell php file to upload on server
  - Gaining access and capturing **user.txt** and **root.txt** flags
