# Day 23 – Module 18: IoT Hacking

## 🔍 What is IoT (Internet of Things)?
- IoT refers to the network of physical objects—“things”—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.

## 🧩 Main Components of IoT
1. **Sensors/Devices** – Responsible for collecting real-time data from the environment.
2. **Connectivity** – Transmits data to cloud or other devices (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, etc.).
3. **Data Processing** – Processes raw data and performs analysis or logic.
4. **User Interface** – Enables interaction with the device or system via dashboards, apps, etc.

## 🏗️ IoT Architecture
### 1. **Perception Layer**
- Also called the **Sensing Layer**
- Responsible for identifying and collecting data from the environment using sensors, RFID, etc.

### 2. **Network/Transport Layer**
- Responsible for **data transmission** between the perception layer and processing systems (uses protocols like Wi-Fi, 4G/5G, Zigbee).

### 3. **Processing Layer**
- Also called the **Middleware Layer**
- Stores, analyzes, and processes the collected data. Often involves cloud computing and big data technologies.

### 4. **Application Layer**
- Delivers **application-specific services** to the user such as smart homes, smart cities, healthcare, etc.
