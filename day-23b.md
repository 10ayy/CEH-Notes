# Day 23 ‚Äì Module 19: Cloud Computing

## ‚òÅÔ∏è What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the **delivery of computing services**‚Äîincluding servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence‚Äî**over the Internet** (‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

## üîß Major Cloud Service Providers
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- **IBM Cloud**
- **Oracle Cloud**
- **Alibaba Cloud**

---

## üß∞ Types of Cloud Computing Services
1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**  
   Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VM).
   
2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**  
   Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications (e.g., Google App Engine, Azure App Services).
   
3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**  
   Provides software applications over the Internet on a subscription basis (e.g., Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Dropbox).

## üåê Cloud Deployment Models
- **Public Cloud**: Infrastructure owned and operated by third-party providers.
- **Private Cloud**: Used exclusively by a single organization.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of both public and private clouds.
- **Community Cloud**: Shared infrastructure for a specific community of users from organizations with common concerns.

---

## üì¶ What is Virtualization?
Virtualization is the process of **creating a virtual version** of computing resources such as hardware platforms, storage devices, and network resources using a **hypervisor** (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V, VirtualBox).

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits of Virtualization
- Efficient resource utilization
- Cost reduction
- Isolation and security
- Simplified disaster recovery
- Rapid scalability and provisioning

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Concerns in Cloud Computing
- **Data breaches** due to weak access control or encryption
- **Insecure APIs** exposing sensitive operations
- **Account hijacking** through phishing or stolen credentials
- **Misconfiguration** leading to data exposure
- **Insider threats** by authorized users misusing data

---

## üí• Common Cloud Computing Attacks
- **Man-in-the-Cloud Attack**
- **Data leakage via insecure APIs**
- **Denial of Service (DoS) on cloud-hosted apps**
- **Account/service hijacking**
- **Side-channel attacks in multi-tenant environments**
- **VM escape and hypervisor attacks**

---

## üìù Summary:

This module provided a comprehensive overview of **cloud computing fundamentals**, including **service models, deployment types, virtualization, benefits, and major security threats**. Emphasis was placed on the **shared responsibility model** and the critical importance of securing cloud environments through best practices, access control, and monitoring.
