## üîÑ Wireless Network Terminology

| Term          | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GSM**       | Global System for Mobile Communication; a standard for mobile networks      |
| **Bandwidth** | The data transfer rate or capacity of a wireless connection                 |
| **Access Point (AP)** | A device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network |
| **SSID**      | Service Set Identifier ‚Äì name of the wireless network                       |
| **BSSID**     | Basic Service Set Identifier ‚Äì MAC address of the access point              |
| **Hotspot**   | A physical location that provides Internet access over Wi-Fi                |
| **Wi-Fi**     | Wireless networking technology using IEEE 802.11 standards                  |

## üîê Wireless Authentication Methods

- **Open System Authentication**: No password or identity verification required.
- **Shared Key Authentication**: Uses a pre-shared key (PSK) for both authentication and encryption.

## üöó What is Wardriving?
Wardriving is the act of **searching for Wi-Fi wireless networks**, typically in a moving vehicle, using a laptop or smartphone equipped with GPS and a wireless adapter.

## üîê What is Wireless Encryption?

Encryption secures wireless data by encoding it so that only authorized users can decode and access it.

### üìä Types of Wireless Encryption:

| Encryption Type | Description                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **WEP**         | Weak and outdated encryption protocol  |
| **WPA**         | Improved over WEP with TKIP encryption |
| **WPA2**        | Uses AES encryption; widely adopted    |
| **WPA3**        | Most secure; resistant to brute force  |
